# **What I have learned :computer: :woman:** 

- [ ] Since joining @cbfacademy i have learned about different types of command lines and their uses
- [ ] I have also learned about version control systems and gathered an understanding about how and why git and GitHub is used in project work.
- [ ] I know how to connect to git in VSCode terminal 
- [ ] I have learned how to configure git as well as adding a SSH key on GitHub
- [ ] I now know the 4 different areas that git cover (working directory, staging area, local repo and remote rep)
![4 different working areas](https://github.com/cbfacademy/github-fundamentals-ERobertss/assets/133209614/27c3a264-8ff0-4651-a8b3-cb72201f2c8b)
- [ ] Also I am learning the basic wiriting and formatting syntax on GitHub too
- [ ] As i have taken the time outside class to go over the course material [CBF course material](https://academy.codingblackfemales.com/courses/entry-to-tech/lessons/entry-to-tech/) and do further reading on the topics I am not confused about anything as of yet.
